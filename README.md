# Sortopia-SortingAlgorithmsStudy-
This is a study of sorting algorithms that was required to pass the class "Algorithms and Complexity", in this project I had the pleasure to work closely with my professor that has not only helped me understand the concept of sorting algorithms, but also teached me the right way to conduct such comparisons.
