# Sortopia-SortingAlgorithmsStudy-
This is a study of sorting algorithms conducted in the University of Lodz, in this project I had the pleasure to work closely with my professor that has not only helped me understand the concept of sorting algorithms, but also teached me the right way to conduct such comparisons.
